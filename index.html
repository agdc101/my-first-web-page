        <h2><em>A Bit About Me...</em></h2>
        <p>From Telford, England but currently living on Vancouver Island, Canada! Fun-loving, positive minded lad who has just began his journey in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>I am a very active person with a growing list of hobbies! These include my main passions of Football (or Soccer for those weirdos out there) and Skiing.           
         Other hobbies include Fishing, Motor Mechanics and i suppose you could now say coding!</p>

          <p>I decided to begin learning code mainly to challenge myself and to develop a new set of skills. I don’t know what i am expecting to achieve further down the road but the more I learn, the more I am attracted to the prospect of one day working in the tech industry.</p>
